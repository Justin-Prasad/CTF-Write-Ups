# Challenge Description #
A message has come in but it seems to be all scrambled. Luckily it seems to have the key at the beginning. Can you crack this substitution cipher? Download the message [here](https://github.com/Justin-Prasad/CTF-Write-Ups/blob/main/PicoGym/Cryptography/substitution0/message.txt)

# Hints #
Try a frequency attack. An online tool might help.

# Explanation #
This challenge didn't have much to it. From the name alone I inferred that it was a substitution cipher. 

A substitution cipher is a cipher in which alpha-numeric characters are... well... substituted, most often with other letters or numbers.

When using ```cat``` on ```message.txt``` in the terminal, I noticed the top of the file had the line ```QWITJSYHXCNDFERMUKGOPVALBZ```. Seeing as how this was a substitution cipher, I assumed it was the substitution values for the standard alphabet ```ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ```. As one naturally does, I made my way to CyberChef and decided to plug it in. After running it with ```QWITJSYHXCNDFERMUKGOPVALBZ``` as my key, I saw a message that looked like this.

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

```

We can see that we have the actual meat of the flag here in ```mxirCTF{5UB5717U710N_3V0LU710N_03055505}``` so all we need to do is remove ```mxir``` and add ```pico```. Alternatively, one could also append all the lower case letters to the plaintext and ciphertext on CyberChef to reveal the flag.

```picoCTF{5UB5717U710N_3V0LU710N_03055505}```
